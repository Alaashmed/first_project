# My First HTML/CSS Project

Welcome to my first HTML/CSS project on GitHub!

## About
This project was created as part of my learning journey in web development. It is a simple static website that showcases my early web design skills.

## Note
- This project is not responsive and might not work well on smaller screens or mobile devices.
- I used basic and straightforward code as I am just starting to learn web development.

## Feedback
I am open to feedback and suggestions to improve my project. Feel free to create issues or submit pull requests.
